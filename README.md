data
====

Data generated for the test of my thesis (source code: contribution to the [BNSTRUCT](https://github.com/magodellepercussioni/bnstruct) package). Includes several instances of different sizes of the Bayesian Networks
- Asia (8 nodes)
- Child (20 nodes)
- Insurance (27 nodes)
- Alarm (37 nodes)
- Hepar II (70 nodes)
- Andes (223 nodes)

As the [GOBNILP](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/aig/sw/gobnilp/) package currently reads a slightly different default format than the one provided in the `data` subfolder (or at least I have skipped that section in the documentation), datasets are provided also in that different format.

Original networks can be found [here](http://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/) with citation of the original source.

In the directory `results` we also provide the raw data generated in output by the different algorithms tested: that of my thesis (any name?), MMHC, GOBNILP.
